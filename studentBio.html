		<h2>Manny Salcido</h2>

		<img src="selfie.jpg" alt="Manny's Selfie">

		<p>Originally from El Paso, I've lived in the Dallas area for about 4 years, and I should have moved here a long time ago. I work in Travel Management, but my real passions include fiddling with computer hardware, front-end code, and getting into adventures with my dogs. I've been married to my lovely wife Bella for a little over a year now. We got married on Leap Day 2016, so I'll only have to buy an anniversary gift every 4 years. I love to travel; mainly to the beach. And, I occasionally binge watch NetFlix shows; lately, it's been "Better Call Saul"</p>
